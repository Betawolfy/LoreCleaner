# * Lore cleaner
# * By: @betawolfy
# * Version: 1.0

# * Made for TFR

# * This script is used to clean the lore.txt file
# * It removes timestamps, removes all strings contained in the remove.txt file, removes all non-alphanumeric characters, removes extra whitespaces, and removes leading/trailing whitespaces.
# * The cleaned text is saved to lore_cleaned.txt

# * Usage:
# * 1. Place the lore.txt file in the same directory as this script
# * 2. Add any strings that need to be removed to the remove.txt file
# * 3. Run the script using ```python index.py```
# * 4. The cleaned text will be saved to lore_cleaned.txt

# * Note: The remove.txt file contains strings that are removed from the text. You can add more strings to this file if needed.
# * Normally, you don't need to modify the script. Just add the lore.txt file and run the script.

# End of the script

# * Note: The script is designed to be simple and easy to use. It can be modified or extended as needed for specific requirements. For example, additional cleaning steps or processing can be added to the clean_text function. The script can also be integrated into a larger pipeline or workflow for text processing tasks.
